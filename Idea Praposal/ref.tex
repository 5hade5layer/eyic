\large {The current daily household waste management system has various limitation 2 of the major one being waste segregation and the other is waste collection.
	In order to efficiently collect daily waste from households and manage them we came up with a solution that is to connect the households and the collectors via apps and share data between them through the dustbins at each household. 
	The current problems of waste segregation and transportation are solved by our solution. This allows the collection workers to have a more hygienic working environment and save fuel by not going to every single house every day without checking if the house has or could give waste.
