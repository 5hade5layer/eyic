\textup{\huge {\bf Introduction/Motivation: } \\[0.90in] }

\large  {The Inability of the current waste collection system to prompt the households to segregate waste before giving it out to the collectors, forcing the collection workers to separate it manually before treatment making their working conditions unhygienic and wasting their time, and lack of proper communication between the collectors and the household leads inefficient path planning without considering which all household actually have/could give waste at the particular time of pick up wasting fuel and time.}\\[0.3in]

\large  {Our solution is a system which consists of two apps one for the households, another for the collectors which become the communication medium between collectors and households, like allowing the household to get the live location of the collection vehicle, notify the collectors which all households actually have/could give waste at pick-up time. To make this communication more hassle free we introduced a dustbin which is provided to each household this dustbin allows us to trace back to the source of the waste if the waste was not segregated and detect if waste is present in it or not each day and it alerts our system via home Wi-Fi and helps to give an optimized path for the collectors to pick the waste.}\\[0.3in]
