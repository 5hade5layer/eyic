\Large  { [1] In India, it is estimated that MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) generated in large cities and towns in India is about 0.1 kg, 0.3 â€“ 0.4 kg and 0.5 kg per capita per day respectively. }\\

\Large  {	In most of the cities in India, the MSW collection, segregation, transportation, processing and disposal are carried by Private collectors or respective municipal corporations }\\[0.003in]
	
\Large {	The collection and transportation section are in of loss because some households do not have/could not give waste at a particular time and as for the segregation part the waste may come mixed but there is no way of tracking them to its source hence not prompting households to segregate waste.}\\[0.003in]
	
\Large {	There are many software-based waste management systems but most of them are targeted at waste collection from a large-scale events or public places, none are targeted for daily household waste collection and they have their own collection workers to collect waste. }\\[0.3in]
